# javascript30-1-alt

Alternate solution to the JS Drum Kit from Day 1 of [Wes Bos' 30 Day Javascript Coding Challenge](http://javascript30.com). This solution is somewhat simpler and uses classList.toggle('playing') on both 'keydown' and 'keyup' events to achieve the same effect as Wes' proposed version which uses 'transitionend' event.
